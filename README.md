# Simple Trivia Game Application

I built this web application in order to practice building an app in React. The questions and answers are provided by the Open Trivia Database API https://opentdb.com/api_config.php. This application does not connect to a database so users and scores do not persist, features I'd like to add in the future.

## Setup

If you would like to run this application locally, download the files and install all dependencies. The game will then be accessible on https://localhost:3000. 

## Usage

If you would just like to play the game, you can find the public deployment here: https://trivia-game-virid.vercel.app/.
